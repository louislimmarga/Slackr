Our plans for iteration 2 would be that everyone would be implementing the function that they have created the test file for. This is because that person would have the best understanding in the group on how to implement the functions they have created the test for. We would also mark downs the succession of our function implementation by checking it using the pytest we have written in iteration 1. Emphasize will be given on functions that were used the most in testing another function e.g auth_register() would be the highest priority to be finished first since every other functions' test rely on auth_register() working.
 Since we have 3 weeks to finish iteration 2, we will divided our timeline into 3 parts:
    -By the end of first week, we would be able to finish all of our functions' error checking (e.g. checking valid arguments were passed in)
    -By the end of the second week, all of our functions implementation would finish and needs to be able to pass the pytests we created in iteration1
    -On week 3, we will be mainly dealing with functions that is really hard to be implement (e.g standup functions). It is expected that not all functions would be able to be completed by end of week 2 and things would need to change along the way.
